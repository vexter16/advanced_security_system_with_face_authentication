// FaceRecord related server actions (getFaces, addFace, deleteFace) have been removed.
// The frontend components (ManageFacesClient.tsx, LockScreenForm.tsx)
// will now directly call the Python backend API endpoints using `fetch`.

// If you need Next.js server actions to act as a proxy to your Python backend
// (e.g., to hide API keys or handle complex server-to-server logic),
// you would re-implement them here to call your Python API.

// For now, this file is largely empty regarding face management
// to reflect that the primary logic has moved to the Python backend
// and direct client-side API calls.

// You can keep other non-face-related server actions here if your application has them.
